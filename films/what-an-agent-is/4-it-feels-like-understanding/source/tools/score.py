# It feels like understanding: the music and sounds, played by tools/audio.py with From words to data's instruments (shared/tools/music.py).
# A new palette, chosen on 3 November 2026 and checked against every score.py on main and on every branch, and against the series' other
# films (palettes.md): two instruments, both made here, as music.py has neither.
#  - A steel tongue drum: tongues cut into a closed steel shell, struck with soft mallets. A round, even note that blooms a moment after
#    the strike and fades, from a shell you can't see into: the agent's sound, and the sound of a fluent answer, quick, pleasing and sure.
#  - A bowed psaltery: a small triangle of strings, each bowed on its own near its pin. One slow, held note at a time, never two at once,
#    with no vibrato: the person who stops, asks and checks.
# Neither belongs to a tradition whose music the film could borrow, and nothing here imitates the music of any culture: no mode, ornament
# or rhythm of any tradition.
# The marks mean the same all through:
#  - The drum's figure, B D F# B in 1999 and D F# A D from Odyssey on: a note for each small push as the orbiter leaves Earth; a little
#    lower each time round in the nine months; whole as Odyssey goes into orbit; and under the psaltery's held D at the title and the end.
#  - The fluent sound: the drum, quick and even, a little too smooth: thirty years of routine, the answer's glow, a run of right answers.
#  - The two teams answer each other a fifth apart, the drum and the psaltery; the units' bubbles are one short figure in two keys at once.
#  - A doubt raised and never settled is one soft psaltery note, C sharp, left unanswered: the emails of 1999, and Anil's chat.
#  - The 720 students who never had their call are one low psaltery note, B, held, with no pulse.
#  - Two meanings of one word are two notes a tone apart that never meet; a question and its answer are a third apart, psaltery then drum.
#  - The three changes, Odyssey's and Jun's team's, are three rising psaltery notes, D F# A.
#  - A rating of how well we understand is its dots as notes: the scale climbing as each dot lights, and the same notes going back down.
# B minor for 1999 until "Something had to change"; D major, its relative, from Odyssey on and for today. Every chord is tuned pure from
# the key's note (just intonation, see hz()); the two keys share every note but E, which each tunes its own way.
# The rules the series keeps (its briefs, 3 November 2026, as the governance and master data films did):
#  - Music only from time to time: under the opening story, and after it only at a chapter's turn, under a moment on screen or in a
#    pause without words; never a bed under the voice. tools/quiet.py checks that after the opening no chapter has music for more than
#    half its length, or for 12 seconds without a break.
#  - Nothing trembles: every note is one string or one tongue, steady, with no vibrato, its partials harmonic once the strike has passed,
#    and every chord tuned pure. The one urgent pulse is in the opening, low and muted, from "the 23rd of September" under the engine's
#    glow, and it stops on "passed behind Mars" (film.json lists the opening in "urgent").
#  - Every sound is an event on screen, at the moment it appears. Each one below uses the same timing as the picture in src/scenes.js
#    (the same word and offset), so sound and picture stay together when the voice is re-timed. The radio line makes no sound, so its
#    ending is heard as silence.
# And everything stays low and soft, below about 2.5 kHz; the drum and the psaltery matched by loudness, the effects about 12 dB under.

# when a word of a line is spoken, as the film's own wAt() estimates it: along the line's voiced length, from the words the voice reads.
# wAt() falls back to the line's start when a word isn't in it; here a missing word stops the mix, so a typo can't move a sound
