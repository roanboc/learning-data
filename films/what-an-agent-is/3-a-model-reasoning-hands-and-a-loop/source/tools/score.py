# A model, reasoning, hands and a loop: the music and sounds, played by tools/audio.py with From words to data's instruments
# (shared/tools/music.py). A new palette, checked on 3 November 2026 against every score.py on main and on every branch, and against the
# series' other films (palettes.md): one clean electric guitar, played two ways, and an electric bass, all made here, as music.py has
# none of them.
#  - The guitar plucked softly with the thumb, on its neck pickup, its tone turned down: the hands reaching, and the data coming back.
#    The same guitar's harmonics (a string touched lightly over a fret as it's plucked: a pure, round note) for a check that passes,
#    and a note muted with the side of the hand for one that doesn't, yet.
#  - The guitar held by an e-bow, a small magnet held over a string that hears the string and pushes it again, so it sounds for as long
#    as it's held: a loop of its own, as Sperry's box and the agent are. It swells, holds steady and, lifted off, rings on as a plucked
#    string does. It holds the chords, at a chapter's turn and under a moment; and a held chord is a person who watches and decides.
#  - An electric bass, played with the thumb, round and low: each correction, the pilot's arms, Sperry's box bringing the wing back,
#    and the agent's loop going round again.
# The marks mean the same all through:
#  - The loop: three plucked notes, G, C and D, for "Plan", "Act" and "Check", each as the agent's light reaches its step. When the
#    check passes, the line falls home, B then G (home()); while it fails, the e-bow takes up the D and holds it with its fourth, a G
#    above, unresolved (fails()).
#  - Sperry's box: its loop has no "Plan", so its figure is the loop's without its first note: C and D, then home (boxfig()). A plain
#    script plays the box's figure too, the same way every time.
#  - A correction: the bass's two notes, D then G (fix()).
#  - The three tools: each its own plucked note as it arrives, Catalog C, Query E and Docs G, and the same note as its data comes back
#    or a plan names it.
# G major; E minor for the problem in 1914, and C for the box; the chapters turn on E minor (Jun's question), C (a model writes),
# B minor (reasoning: A minor's fifth is out of tune here), C (hands), G (the loop, the answer, the close) and D (a plain script).
# Every chord is tuned pure from G (just intonation, see hz()); A is never held with E, nor F with C (their fifths aren't pure here),
# no two notes a semitone apart are held together, and the seventh partial, which beats against any 5-limit note, is left low.
# The rules the series keeps (its briefs, 3 November 2026, as the governance and master data films did):
#  - Music only from time to time: under the opening story, and after it only at a chapter's turn, under a moment on screen or in a
#    pause without words; never a bed under the voice. tools/quiet.py checks that after the opening no chapter has music for more than
#    half its length, or for 12 seconds without a break, that it comes in at most once every 10 seconds on average, that no figure
#    comes back soon after itself, and that the music and the effects sit as low as the governance films' (the author's review, 4
#    November 2026, found this film's audio "a bit disruptive and repetitive": its music came in every five seconds, Sperry's box
#    played its figure six times, and its music sat 2 to 4 dB louder than theirs, its effects 6 to 9 dB).
#  - Nothing trembles or pulses: each note is one string, steady, with no vibrato or bend, its partials harmonic; every chord pure; the
#    plucked notes damped by the player before they'd ring into the next chapter. No urgent pulse: the failed check isn't a crisis, only
#    a reason to go round again.
#  - Every sound is an event on screen, at the moment it appears. Each one below uses the same timing as the picture in src/scenes.js
#    (the same word and offset), so sound and picture stay together when the voice is re-timed.
# And everything stays low and soft, below about 2.4 kHz; the effects about 12 dB under the music.

# when a word of a line is spoken, as the film's own wAt() estimates it: along the line's voiced length, from the words the voice reads.
# wAt() falls back to the line's start when a word isn't in it; here a missing word stops the mix, so a typo can't move a sound

# 1. Hands off: the opening, the series' story from outside data. 1914 by the Seine: the river and the crowd, a few seconds each; the
#    e-bow holds G as the crowds line the river; the flying boat comes in, its engine far off; the bass enters with Sperry and Cachin.
#    The problem, E minor: each gust a breath of air, the first with a plucked note that leans away and the bass bringing it back, the
#    second the bass alone; the chord thins as his arms and back ache, to the bass alone as the aeroplane slips and falls; on
#    "Something has to change", nothing. The box, C: the gyroscopes spin up under a held fifth on the e-bow; the aeroplane tips, a note
#    leans, the valve puffs, the piston knocks, and the bass's two notes bring it level. Over the river the engine passes; Sperry lets
#    go and raises his hands: the box's figure, the guitar alone. Cachin climbs out, the wing creaks and dips, and the bass brings it
#    back; the crowd cheers. The prize, G, the e-bow rising to the third; today's pilots, who watch and decide, held. In the room, the
#    box's figure for its hands, check and loop, and a muted note where a plan would be; the model drops in, its plan's note; the
#    agent's ring, the loop's mark whole for the first time, and the title on G

#    a new plan, its note; the rule from Docs and the new query, touched; the new query's data; the check, and it passes, falling home,
#    and a held G. Unlike Sperry's box, which can only push back (its correction), the model decides what to try next (the plan's
#    note). The loop stops: when the checks pass, at its limit, or when it needs a person (held). After the author's review (4 November
#    2026: "a bit disruptive and repetitive"), the chapter's sixteen figures in a minute were too many: the acts, a second plan note,
#    the second round's tool notes and the stops before "a person" now go without music
