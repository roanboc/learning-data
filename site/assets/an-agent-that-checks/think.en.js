/* Learning Data: "Pause and think" for An agent that checks, in English. Keep the keys in step with think.es.js.
   The film stops at the end of three chapters (today, decides, written), with one question each. think.js shows them,
   and lists them again under "Think it through" (#think-list). The series' labs and scenarios are its own, for all its films
   (assets/data-governance/), so no question has a "stop"; the page's .player data-labs leads to them. */

  "today":{q:"Anil's change comes back with four gaps. Why does he still have to wait for someone?",
    opts:[{t:"The checks found gaps, so a person must fill them in before the agent checks again.",near:true},{t:"The checks say what's missing, not what's right for this list, or who decides it.",ok:true},{t:"Every change, with or without gaps, waits for Jun's approval before it goes in."}],
    why:"A check can say a column has no class. It can't say whether this list's columns identify a person, or who answers for the list: those are decisions for the people who own the data. Until someone names them, every change nobody else owns waits for the one person who knows the rules. In your work, which requests wait for one person?"},
  "decides":{q:"The agent saw a long code with two values for seven learners. Why didn't it class it as identifying no one?",
    opts:[{t:"The evidence disagreed, so the checklist says to draft the stricter class and ask the owner, who knows what the code is made from.",ok:true},{t:"Seven learners is too few to judge, so the agent always classes small columns as identifying people, whatever the evidence says."},{t:"The evidence disagreed, so the checklist says to leave the column without a class until the next nightly run gathers more values.",near:true}],
    why:"A class is a claim about the data, and it decides what's protected. The counts said maybe not a person; the code looked like one that is. So the agent drafted the stricter class, said it wasn't sure, and asked, and Anil, who knows the list, decided. Where would you want a helper to say “not sure” instead of guessing?"},
  "written":{q:"“Staff take care to use terms correctly.” Could an agent check it? What could take its place?",
    opts:[{t:"No, so the line stays as it is, and the stewards remind staff of it at their meeting each term."},{t:"Yes, partly: the agent can sample reports each month and score how carefully staff used each of the glossary's terms.",near:true},{t:"No: care can't be checked. A check that every term in a report comes from the glossary can, or a decision someone owns; or the line goes.",ok:true}],
    why:"An agent can only follow what's written plainly enough to check, and “take care” names nothing to look at. Every term in a report coming from the glossary is something a check can confirm every night. Pick a line from a policy you know: could an agent check it?"}
