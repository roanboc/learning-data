# Decided: In the weeds of data crafting

The series' own decisions. With each film's rows (`<n-film>/decided.md`), they make the *Decided* table in [proposal.md](proposal.md): run `python site-tools/build_series.py` after adding a row. A decision a film's thread makes, even one for the whole series, goes in that film's file, so threads never edit the same lines.

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 29 September 2026 | A series for analytics engineers that continues *From words to data*, one level deeper: how modelling decisions become dbt code. |
| 29 September 2026 | The stack: Databricks, with dbt Cloud. |
| 29 September 2026 | The thread stays the credential, at the same university, with the same sources. |
| 29 September 2026 | A **core** layer between intermediate and marts holds the enterprise contract. |
| 29 September 2026 | Enterprise (core) models are `public`; consumer marts are `protected`. Domains and dbt Mesh get their own film. |
| 29 September 2026 | Known modelling approaches are named once, in the opening film. After that, the series teaches mechanisms (key sets, hashing, grain, timelines) without saying which approach each came from. |
| 29 September 2026 | Ingestion is out of scope: data arrives with every version kept (SCD2) and system keys identified. Ingestion can be its own series. |
| 29 September 2026 | *A model is not a transformation* opens in the past, with a blueprint; alternatives to dbt get generic labels; it ends by showing what the series covers. |
| 29 September 2026 | A new character, Jun, the analytics engineer, builds what Noor, the architect, owns. |
| 30 September 2026 | The series title: *In the weeds of data crafting*. It says the content is technical; the title card and the opening film's narration say it's for analytics engineers. |
| 30 September 2026 | The series gets its own sound: an electric piano, a plucked bass and a brushed pulse, and its own four-note mark. |
| 5 November 2026 | Words never show twice where one chapter meets the next, as the author asked on 5 November 2026 ("Yes, fix that everywhere"). The engine fades each chapter into the next over 0.8 s, and 31 joins in films 1 to 9 showed the same words twice for that time, a little apart or at another size. Each film's `CHAPTER_JOINS` (From words to data's `shared/src/joins.js`) now says how such a chapter comes in: 21 carry the picture on, the camera starting where the chapter before left it (`glide`), and 10 later moments let what was there leave first, over the bare screen (`leave`). `tools/check.py` now runs the governance films' `twice.py` on every chapter join, so CI stops one that shows words twice. |
| 10 November 2026 | *Written once*: owners and stewards never review pull requests, as the author said on 10 November 2026. The lab *Find the home* and Pause and think after *Four copies* now say Mei approves the award's definition in the glossary, the conceptual model copies it, and the data team reviews the one line that changes, in English and Spanish. The narration ("change one line, with Mei's approval") is kept for now, without a re-voice. |
