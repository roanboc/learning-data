# Governance on Databricks: tags, masks, a policy and a catalogue

Optional. Everything here runs only on the `databricks` target; DuckDB stays the default and needs
none of it. The project decides each column's class once, in the model's YAML (`meta.personal_data`),
and the platform protects what the project says is personal (DEC-PRJ-13). Product names and their
status were checked on 20 October 2026, sections 5 to 7 on 28 October, section 8 on 29 October, sections 9 and 10 on 4 November, and section 10 again and section 11 on 5 November: check them again on the day.

## 1. Tags, every build

Nothing to set up. After each table builds, every classified column gets a Unity Catalog tag,
`personal_data`, with its class: `direct`, `pseudonymous` or `none`
(`macros/governance/personal_data.sql`). Change the class in the YAML and the next build changes the tag.

```bash
dbt build --target databricks --profiles-dir .
```

## 2. Masks, one per column

Name the group that may see direct personal data, and add the identity that runs dbt to it: a model
that reads a masked column sees what its reader sees.

```bash
dbt build --target databricks --profiles-dir . --vars '{personal_data_readers: personal_data_readers}'
```

Before the build, dbt creates `mask_personal_data` in the target's schema; after each table, it sets
that mask on each `direct` column. Everyone outside the group reads `***`.

## 3. Or one policy, by tag

Unity Catalog's attribute-based access control (ABAC) masks by tag: one policy covers every column
tagged `personal_data = direct`, in every schema of the catalog, including tables built later. A
column with its own mask conflicts with a policy on it, so use this or step 2, not both.

1. An account admin makes `personal_data` a **governed tag**, with the allowed values `direct`,
   `pseudonymous` and `none` (Catalog Explorer: *Govern*, *Governed Tags*, *Create governed tag*).
   Governed, only those three values can be set, and only by someone with `ASSIGN` on the tag:
   give it to the identity that runs dbt.
2. Build with the policy var, so the build tags and leaves masking to the policy:

   ```bash
   dbt build --target databricks --profiles-dir . \
       --vars '{personal_data_readers: personal_data_readers, personal_data_policy: true}'
   ```

3. Create the policy once (you need MANAGE on the catalog; serverless or Databricks Runtime 16.4 or above):

   ```bash
   dbt run-operation create_personal_data_policy --target databricks --profiles-dir . \
       --vars '{personal_data_readers: personal_data_readers, personal_data_policy: true}'
   ```

   It runs `create or replace policy mask_direct_personal_data on catalog …`, with the mask, to
   `account users` except the readers, matching `has_tag_value('personal_data', 'direct')`.
   `SHOW EFFECTIVE POLICIES` shows what applies to a table.

Some of ABAC is in Beta (policies on views, on the whole metastore): check what's in preview on the day.

## 4. Products in a catalogue

Ontos, from Databricks Labs, is a business catalogue for Unity Catalog: data products, data contracts,
glossaries and semantic models, with review workflows. It runs as a Databricks App (its README:
`databricks bundle deploy`, then `databricks apps deploy`). It follows ODCS v3.1.0, the version of the
contracts in `governance/5-data-contracts/`, and the Open Data Product Standard, as
`governance/6-product-descriptors/` does. Load the
contracts and products from there; the files in this repository stay their home, and the catalogue
keeps a copy (Noor's map: *data contract* and *data product* in `governance/3-architecture-map/4-information/`).

Ontos is in Databricks Labs, and its README states no support terms. In the films it's an example; the project names
no tool as the only way.

## 5. Areas, from each model's domain

People look for data by area, not by layer, and the Discover page shows a catalog's tables by
area, as domains. After each table other teams read builds, dbt sets its model's domain
(`meta.domain`) as a key-only tag of the same name: `student` on the learner table
(`macros/governance/domain_tag.sql`, DEC-PRJ-15). Nothing to set in the build. Once, on the platform:

1. Someone with `MANAGE DISCOVER` (account and workspace admins have it) creates a domain for each
   area, `student`, `course`, `learning`, `planning`, `finance` and `wallet`, each on a governed
   tag of its name. A table joins its domain when it carries the tag.
2. Give the identity that runs dbt `ASSIGN` on each of those tags.

The catalog and its schemas stay as dbt builds them, a schema for each layer: `prod_core` and
`prod_marts`, when `DATABRICKS_SCHEMA` is `prod`.

## 6. Who read it

Unity Catalog's audit log, the system table `system.access.audit`, records who read each table,
and when: a read is a `getTable` event, with the table's full name in `request_params.full_name_arg`.
It's in Public Preview, and keeps a year. `analyses/governance/who_read_a_table.sql` asks who read
the learner table this month:

```bash
dbt compile --target databricks --profiles-dir . --select who_read_a_table
```

Then run the SQL it writes in `target/compiled/` on a SQL warehouse. Reading the log takes
`USE CATALOG` on `system`, and `USE SCHEMA` and `SELECT` on `system.access`, which an admin grants.

## 7. The access review

Each December, the platform team reads the grants themselves: who can read each table, and through
which group. `analyses/governance/access_review.sql` lists the learner table's, from
`system.information_schema.table_privileges`: each grantee and its privilege, including grants made
on its schema or catalog. Who is in each group, and until when, is in the university's
directory, which the platform syncs: Unity Catalog's grants have no end date of their own.

```bash
dbt compile --target databricks --profiles-dir . --select access_review
```

The information schema shows someone with only `MANAGE` on a table just their own grants on it.
If a grant you expect is missing, check the table with `SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE`.

## 8. Asking for a product

How someone gets a product other teams read, as the university sets it up. Nothing here runs in the
build: the catalogue keeps its own workflows, and the directory its groups (Noor's map: each piece
where it lives).

1. **A readers' group for each product.** Each product has a group in the university's directory,
   named after it: `learners_near_an_award_readers`. The group holds `SELECT` on the product's output
   tables from the day the product goes live, so access is granted once, to the group, never to a
   person. For Planning's marts, the project grants it when the `planning_readers` var names the group:

   ```bash
   dbt build --target databricks --profiles-dir . --vars '{planning_readers: [learners_near_an_award_readers]}'
   ```

2. **One place to ask.** On the platform, the catalog's access request destination is a redirect URL
   to the catalogue: someone who asks for a table on the platform goes to the catalogue's form instead
   of the platform's. Unity Catalog's access requests are in Public Preview.
3. **A request with a reason and an end.** In the catalogue, a request says why, and for how long:
   30, 60 or 90 days, never without a date. It goes to the owners of the product's domain: for
   *Learners near an award*, Clara Jensen, Planning (`governance/4-data-products/learners_near_an_award.yml`),
   not whoever built the table. The owner decides the days, or says no, with a reason. The catalogue
   keeps the request as the record: who asked, why, who decided, and until when.
4. **Access until a date.** On a yes, the catalogue's workflow adds the requester to the product's
   readers' group in the directory, until the date. It reminds them a week before, and on the date
   the directory ends the membership: Unity Catalog's grants have no end date of their own.
5. **A known reader.** A team that keeps using a product adds what it builds from it to `exposures/`,
   in its own folder, as the Faculty of Health's placements plan is (`exposures/health/`). The impact
   check then names it among who to tell, and `CODEOWNERS` asks it to review a change to its file.

Outside the university, a product that holds no one's personal data, such as *Awards*, can be
shared with a partner through OpenSharing: a share of its output tables, which the partner reads
where they are, on any platform, with a recipient token that ends within a year, and its contract
sent with it. A product that holds personal data isn't shared outside without an agreement that
allows it.

## 9. Agents, under the same rules

An agent that works on its own, at night or in a job, never signs in as a person: not with their
sign-in, and not with their personal access token, which Databricks calls a legacy way to sign in.
It works as its own service principal, an identity made for software (`AGENTS.md`, *Your access*),
and a person owns it and answers for what it does. Then the sections above hold for it as they do
for people.

1. **Only what its job needs.** Grant the service principal what its job reads, and nothing to write
   where it only reads. The Faculty of Health's workload agent, which answers its heads of school's
   weekly counts of who teaches, reads the two HR tables and writes nowhere:

   ```sql
   grant use catalog on catalog <production catalog> to `<workload agent>`;
   grant use schema on schema <production catalog>.<schema>_staging to `<workload agent>`;
   grant select on table <production catalog>.<schema>_staging.stg_hr_system__staff to `<workload agent>`;
   grant select on table <production catalog>.<schema>_staging.stg_hr_system__contracts to `<workload agent>`;
   ```

   To stop it, an admin deactivates its service principal: it can't sign in, everyone else works on,
   and its grants stay for when it's switched on again.
2. **The masks it already meets.** Section 3's policy masks every column tagged `direct` for
   `account users` except the readers, and `account users` holds every user and every service
   principal in the account. An agent outside the readers' group reads stars, as Clara does, with no
   rule written for agents, and a row filter's `TO` clause covers it the same way. The staff key, a
   hash of the staff ID, isn't tagged, so it stays readable, and an agent can count without a name.
3. **Its tools, granted like tables.** A Unity Catalog function an agent calls as a tool needs
   `EXECUTE` on it, with `USE CATALOG` and `USE SCHEMA` on its catalog and schema: the agent can run
   it, and can't change it. The count of active research projects is one, `active_projects(faculty)`
   (`examples/agents-on-databricks/active_projects.sql`):

   ```sql
   grant execute on function <production catalog>.<research schema>.active_projects to `<project check agent>`;
   ```

4. **Models and tool servers, through Unity Gateway.** Unity Gateway, part of Unity Catalog, has been
   generally available since 4 August 2026. Each model the university allows is a model service in
   the catalog. By default only its owner can call it: to let an agent call it, grant the agent's
   service principal `EXECUTE` on it, with `USE CATALOG` and `USE SCHEMA` on its catalog and schema.
   Tool servers from outside are registered the same way, as MCP services, each with its own
   `EXECUTE`. On each service:
   - **Service policies**, in Beta, check what goes in and what comes out.
     `system.ai.detect_sensitive_data` finds structured personal data in a prompt, such as an email
     address, and blocks the call or redacts the value; it finds no names.
     `system.ai.block_jailbreak` detects jailbreak and prompt-injection content.
   - **A rate limit**, in queries or tokens a minute, for a user, a group or a service principal.
   - **Usage**: every call is a row of `system.ai_gateway.usage`, with its requester (a user or a
     service principal) and its tokens, so the faculty or office an agent works for sees what it costs.
5. **Its work, under its own name.** Section 6's query lists the agent's reads under its service
   principal's ID, apart from people's; `system.access.table_lineage` shows the tables its queries
   read; and section 7's review lists its grants with everyone else's.

## 10. Context and memory, one way

What agents read is governed like any data (`AGENTS.md`, *Context and memory are data*). Its home is
the repository, where every change is a pull request its owner reviews (`CODEOWNERS`). From there it
goes one way, to where agents read it on Databricks, and nobody edits it there.

1. **Descriptions, as comments.** `persist_docs` (`dbt_project.yml`) writes each model's and each
   column's description into Unity Catalog as comments, each time it builds the model (DEC-PRJ-04).
   A comment edited in the catalog is written over by the next build.
2. **Skills, in Unity Gateway (Beta).** Each skill in `skills/` becomes a Unity Catalog object, with
   an owner (whoever published it), permissions (`READ VOLUME` to use it; `WRITE VOLUME`, with
   `READ VOLUME`, to change it) and an audit of who created, changed, deleted or read it, and who was
   granted it. Databricks' sync notebook, run on a schedule, copies the skills from the repository:
   it creates new ones and updates changed ones, and never deletes one. A skill deleted here is
   deleted there too, by hand.
3. **The team's memory (Beta).** Agent sessions and agent memory are kept in stores in Lakebase,
   the platform's Postgres database. The store is the security boundary: there's no access for each
   entry, so whoever may write to a store may change any entry in it. A memory pipeline, run about
   every 24 hours, reads a session store, and may rewrite, merge, split or delete the entries in its
   memory store. So the team keeps two memory stores (`memory/README.md`): the proposals store, which
   the pipeline writes and no agent reads; and the team's store, which a script loads from
   `memory/entries/`, and which agents read under a read-only grant (`permission="READ"`).
4. **Kept, then deleted.** Sessions are kept for 30 days; then a scheduled job deletes them.
   Deleting a session, or a session store, doesn't delete the memory kept from it: an entry is
   deleted as its file, here, and from the team's store at the next load.

## 11. Critical data, as a tag

Data is good enough for a use, or not, and each use of a table depends on a few of its columns.
The model's YAML names them: a column's `meta.critical_for` lists the uses that can't do without it
(the graduation list's printed name for the certificates and the programme; its ceremony and
attendance for the seating plan). After the table builds, dbt tags each of those columns with the
key-only tag `critical_data`, and takes the tag off a column no use needs any more
(`macros/governance/critical_data.sql`). The same columns are the contract's critical data elements
(`criticalDataElement`), and its quality section says what each use needs, at the level agreed with
the people who use it (`docs/conventions.md`, *What each use needs*). Once, on the platform:

1. An account admin makes `critical_data` a governed tag, with no values (Catalog Explorer:
   *Govern*, *Governed Tags*, *Create governed tag*). Governed, only those with `ASSIGN` on it can
   set it, so a column is marked critical where its uses are written down, and nowhere else.
2. Give the identity that runs dbt `ASSIGN` on it. It owns the tables it builds, which is enough to
   tag their columns; anyone else needs `APPLY TAG` on the table too.

Tagging a column takes Databricks Runtime 16.1 or above, or a SQL warehouse. To list every critical
column in the catalog, and the table it's in:

```sql
select schema_name, table_name, column_name
from information_schema.column_tags
where tag_name = 'critical_data'
```
