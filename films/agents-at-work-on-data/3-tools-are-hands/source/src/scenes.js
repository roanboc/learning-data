/* ===== Tools are hands, and every hand is a permission: the scenes =====
   Seven chapters on the narration. The opening follows Oxford's library from the 1400s to today: the books arrive, are taken away,
   the room stands empty for half a century, Bodley restores it on one rule, the rule holds even for a king, and every reader still
   promises it. Then the lab: each tool an agent gets is a hand; rules ask, rights hold; six hands with the fewest rights; two people
   to production; a hidden line that meets hands that can't do what it asks; and the count on the board. Two framings of one moment
   are joined by a cut, and people fade whole. */
