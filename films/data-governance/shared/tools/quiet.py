"""The film's sound, checked: python tools/quiet.py, from a film's source folder, after tools/build.py (it plays the score on its own,
so it needs no voice; run it again after every change to tools/score.py, before tools/audio.py mixes it). Every governance film runs it
(its tools/quiet.py, through this folder's run.py), and so does every film of What an agent is (through its module's run.py, with that
module's lang.py).

The films' sound (the author's rule for film music, 20 October 2026; and the author's review of What an agent is, 4 November 2026,
which heard glitches in Decades in the making and found A model, reasoning, hands and a loop "a bit disruptive and repetitive", and
asked for the same fixes in every governance and agent film):
music plays under the opening story from outside data; after that, music and sounds come in from time to time, at a chapter's turn,
under a moment on screen or in a pause without words, never as a constant bed under the voice; nothing in it trembles or pulses, except
an urgent pulse in a chapter where the story turns to an error or a rush, which the film lists in film.json's "urgent"; a figure isn't
played again and again; and the music and the effects sit no louder than in five governance films whose sound the author accepted
(the prologue, Who decides, Rules that run, An agent that checks and Teachers of data, measured this way on 4 November 2026, before
the day's fixes to their own sound).
This plays the film's score (tools/score.py) on its own and checks:
  - when: after the opening, no chapter has music for more than half its length, or for more than 12 seconds without a break, and the
    music sounds for at most 40% of the time after the opening (the five: 26 to 34%);
  - how often: after the opening, the music comes in (after a second or more without it) on average at most once every 10 seconds,
    and at most 5 times in any 30 seconds (the five: once every 10.1 to 21.6 s, and at most 3 to 6 times in 30 s);
  - no repeats: a figure (notes that follow each other within 0.8 s) of two notes or more isn't played again within 20 seconds after
    the opening, nor more than 4 times; in the opening, where chords come back as the story moves, not again within 4 seconds, as the
    three gusts of one opening did, 1.7 s apart (a figure is its notes, found from each note's sound; the same notes in the same order
    are the same figure). Three of the five played a figure again soon (Who decides once, Rules that run twice and An agent that
    checks seven times), and two played one 5 and 9 times (in An agent that checks, a check's two notes); since the author found
    A model, reasoning, hands and a loop repetitive, every film keeps them rarer, these five too;
  - how loud: the music's loud moments (the 90th percentile of its level over 0.4 s while it sounds) at most -26.5 dB of full scale,
    its loudest notes (the 99th percentile over 0.05 s) at most -23 dB, and the effects' loud moments (the 90th percentile over 0.05 s
    while they sound) at most -43 dB, all as one speaker plays the score before tools/audio.py mixes it (the five:
    -27.0 to -30.9 dB, -23.5 to -25.9 dB and -44.2 to -46.7 dB; their voice's median level is about -17.6 dB, so the music's loud
    moments sit 9 to 13 dB under it before the mix ducks the music under the voice, and 18 to 22 dB under while it speaks);
  - one at a time: no more than 12 effects (the sounds on the effects bus; those that begin within 25 ms of each other are heard as
    one, and count once) begin in any one second (the five: 7 to 12, and 18 where nine people clapped in Teachers of data, now one
    soft texture). Many tiny grains in a burst, such as 120 paper flicks in two seconds or 126 coin clinks in one, sound
    like crackle or a buzz: play a few sounds, or one soft texture that swells in;
  - no beats: no two held sounds are a little out of tune with each other, so that they beat, 0.3 to 12 times a second, when a phone's
    one speaker adds the two channels together, loud enough to move the music's level by a fifth or more;
  - no pulse: nothing pulses (urgent(), pulse() or ostinato()) outside the chapters film.json lists in "urgent";
  - held notes keep their level in the room (held.py, which plays the score a second time with its rooms silent and compares each note
    with itself): each room's echo rings within 3 dB of one from 100 Hz to 1.5 kHz, where the notes are; no held note is made more
    than 2 dB louder or quieter by it; and no room is laid over the whole music bus while it holds notes. Scaled by all the energy
    they held, the rooms of 22 films rang 10 to 11 dB louder there than their level said, and moved held notes by up to 17 dB, louder
    or quieter (4 November 2026, after Plan, define the check, do, check found it).
The opening is the chapters film.json lists in "story" (by default, the first). Music is what the score puts on the music bus (put()),
not the effects (X()), and it counts while it's within 24 dB of the music's loudest three seconds. A break is a second or more without.
Each failure names the lines of tools/score.py that placed the sounds. The master data films keep a copy of the first checks each.
python tools/quiet.py --all prints every beat, repeat and busy second it finds, not only the first few."""
