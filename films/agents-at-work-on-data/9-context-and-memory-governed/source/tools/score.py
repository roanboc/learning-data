# Context and memory, governed: the music and sounds, played by tools/audio.py with From words to data's instruments
# (shared/tools/music.py). A new palette, checked on 4 November 2026 against every score.py on main and on every branch, and against the
# series' other films (/mnt/project-files/agentic-data-engineering/series-2/palettes.md, where the series thread reserved the lead for
# this film and this film's thread took the partner): struck glass bars and a baritone sarrusophone, both made here (music.py has
# neither).
#  - The glass bars (a crystallophone), struck with soft mallets, low in their range: what the team knows, kept in the open and looked
#    after. Each bar is a pure tone that rings on and fades, with the faint, cool overtones of glass and the small touch of the mallet
#    on it; no resonator under it, nothing that trembles. A bar sounds for the team's memory: a bar for each card as it stands in the
#    file (the memory's figure, D, F sharp, A, B, D), the wrong line's own note (B), and the bars together for what the team approves.
#  - The baritone sarrusophone, the brass double reed, played softly and low, with no vibrato: the people who look after what the team
#    knows. It holds the low note under the opening, and after it sounds only where a person reviews, approves or owns something; never
#    for an agent. A person's approval is its rising fourth, A to D.
#  - The mark, as the series closes: one bar for each of the series' nine lessons, rising once (D, E, F sharp, A, B, D, E, F sharp, A)
#    as the nine lessons' places appear; then each lesson comes in without music, a card set down, and the film ends on the bars
#    together, D major.
#  - D major for the team and what it keeps; B minor for the wrong line and the units it left out; G major for a question and for
#    the library; A major at "Something had to change", which turns to D as the team governs. No E minor chord: its fifth isn't pure
#    in this tuning.
# The rules the series keeps (its briefs, 4 November 2026, as the module's other films do):
#  - Music only from time to time: under the opening story, and after it only at a chapter's turn, under a moment on screen or in a
#    pause without words; never a bed under the voice. tools/quiet.py checks how much, how often and how loud.
#  - Nothing trembles, pulses or beats: no vibrato, no tremolo, no ostinato; every chord is tuned pure (just intonation from D, see
#    hz()). No urgent pulse: nothing in this story is a rush.
#  - Every sound is an event on screen, at the moment it appears. Each one below uses the same timing as the picture in src/scenes.js
#    (the same word and offset), so sound and picture stay together when the voice is re-timed. A burst on screen (31 days' tiles, 25
#    ticks in a table, ten marks) is one soft sound, never one for each.
# And everything stays low and soft, below about 2.5 kHz.

# when a word of a line is spoken, as the film's own wAt() estimates it: along the line's voiced length, from the words the voice reads.
# wAt() falls back to the line's start when a word isn't in it; here a missing word stops the mix, so a typo can't move a sound

# 1. Lucía's first job: the opening, with music all through it.
#    Planning, today: the bars' home chord, D major, and the sarrusophone's low D under it; the calendar's page. Her agent: a bar. The
#    team's memory: a bar for each card as it stands in the file, the back one first (the memory's figure); kept by the platform, a
#    soft tap as its mark comes. The library's question: G major, open. The draft: an open fifth, A and E. A plain check stops it: the
#    stamp, and B minor, the sarrusophone on B; the student system, a card. The 94 left out: two bars falling. The library would have
#    bought none for them: G under B minor, the sarrusophone on G as the ring closes round the very ones. The evidence opens; the line
#    lights: its own note, B, with the sarrusophone's B. Kept in July: D major, and "Right, for rooms": a bar, D (the platform kept it,
#    so no person's note). Lost since last week: three bars falling as the three words fall, then B minor held as nobody saw. The
#    glossary: its card, and G major as the definition lights. Which comes first: the sarrusophone swells on A, and "Something had to
#    change" is A major. The order: D major and the low D; what's governed, a bar for each, and an owner who reviews (a person's
#    approval, A to D); memory second, a lower bar; the definition wins: D major, gently; the flag, a tap. Now: the answer laid down, D
#    major. All 1,236: G major to D as the units come in. For data: the tiers; D major, soft, as what's governed decides; the wrong
#    line's own note, and a tap. The title card: the bars' home chord and the low D

#    records it: a lock. By hand, a few: Mei's approval, A to D. Hundreds a week: a click, one soft brush as the tiles pour in, and B
#    minor. So the platform keeps the memory, and the team governs: D major; first and second, a tap each; the line that disagrees, its

#    stamp as he deletes it. Every agent may read, none may change it: the step's click, and the lock
