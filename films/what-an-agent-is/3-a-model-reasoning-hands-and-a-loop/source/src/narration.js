// A model, reasoning, hands and a loop, the second film of What an agent is, the first series on AI agents in data work. One line per id; the film re-times itself to the voice.
// "gap": the beat after each line. "say": how the voice reads a line, when it differs from the caption (dates in words). The few longer stops are in breath.js.

 {"id":"seats","gap":0.8,"text":"And they stay in their seats, to watch, and decide."},
 {"id":"nomodel","gap":0.8,"text":"Sperry's box has hands, a check and a loop, but no model: it does one known job, the same way every time."},

 {"id":"byhand","gap":0.8,"text":"By hand, that's an afternoon of small corrections: find the tables, read the rules, query, check, fix."},
 {"id":"gives","gap":0.8,"text":"So Jun gives it to an agent, which takes the steps and checks its own work, while he reviews and decides."}

 {"id":"four","gap":0.8,"text":"An agent has four parts, and the first is a model."},
 {"id":"learned","gap":0.8,"text":"It has learned from a vast amount of writing, and it writes what's likely to come next."},
 {"id":"guess","gap":0.8,"text":"Ask it for the census-day count, and the best it can write is a guess: it has never seen the university's records."},

 {"id":"second","gap":0.8,"text":"The second part is reasoning."},

 {"id":"report","gap":0.8,"text":"and check the total against the census report, the university's official count."},
 {"id":"rules","gap":0.8,"text":"It checks the plan against the rules Jun's team gave it: only the university's tools, only reading, and evidence for every answer."},
 {"id":"result","gap":0.8,"text":"It reads each result as feedback, and changes the plan if it must."},
 {"id":"is","gap":0.8,"text":"Reasoning is feedback, and checks against rules."}
]},
"hands":{"name":"Hands","lead":1.0,"tail":1.0,"vo":[
 {"id":"third","gap":0.8,"text":"The third part is hands: a model can't open a table, but tools can."},
 {"id":"three","gap":0.8,"text":"Jun's agent has three: Catalog, which lists the tables; Query, which reads the data; and Docs, with the university's definitions."},
 {"id":"server","gap":0.8,"text":"Each comes from a tool server: a small program that offers it to agents."},
 {"id":"mcp","gap":0.8,"text":"They plug in through an open standard, the Model Context Protocol, so any agent that follows it can use them."},
 {"id":"read","gap":0.8,"text":"Reading is all this job needs, so these three can only read: their account can't change a single row."}

"loop":{"name":"A loop","lead":1.0,"tail":1.0,"vo":[
 {"id":"fourth","gap":0.8,"text":"The fourth part is a loop: plan, act, check, and round again, until the goal is met."},
 {"id":"counts","gap":0.8,"text":"The agent finds the students' table in Catalog, and counts with Query."},
 {"id":"short","gap":0.8,"text":"Then the check: its total is 476 short of the census report."},
 {"id":"today","gap":0.8,"text":"The model reads that feedback: did it count the students as they are today?"},
 {"id":"rule","gap":0.8,"text":"It reads the census rule in Docs: count each student as their record stood on census day."},
 {"id":"again","gap":0.8,"text":"A new query, with that date, gives 18,412."},
 {"id":"passes","gap":0.8,"text":"Its total matches the census report, and the check passes."},
 {"id":"unlike","gap":0.8,"text":"Unlike Sperry's box, which can only push back, the model decides what to try next."},
 {"id":"stops","gap":0.8,"text":"The loop stops when the checks pass, at its limit of tries, or when it needs a person."}

"answer":{"name":"The answer, with its evidence","lead":1.0,"tail":1.0,"vo":[
 {"id":"brings","gap":0.8,"text":"The agent brings Jun its answer: 18,412 students on census day, 454 more than last year."},
 {"id":"evid","gap":0.8,"text":"And its evidence: the tables it read, the rule, both queries, and the check that failed, then passed."},
 {"id":"decides","gap":0.8,"text":"Its check is evidence, not approval: Jun reads it, and decides what goes to Planning."}

 {"id":"march","gap":0.8,"text":"Next March, Planning will want the same count, and now the steps are known."},

 {"id":"runs","gap":0.8,"text":"Every census day, it runs in seconds, for almost nothing, the same way every time, like Sperry's box."},
 {"id":"took","gap":0.8,"text":"The agent took four minutes and twelve steps. A plain rerun needs no agent."},
 {"id":"web","gap":0.3,"text":"An agent can also take the long way: one of the team's agents once searched the web for the census rules,"},
 {"id":"docs","gap":0.8,"text":"though Docs had them, because its plan didn't name its tools."},
 {"id":"names","gap":0.8,"text":"Now each plan names its tools, and gives the agent only those the job needs."},
 {"id":"known","gap":0.8,"text":"Where the steps can be written down, let a plain script run them."},
