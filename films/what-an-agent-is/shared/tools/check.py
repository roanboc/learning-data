"""Check the film before a long render: python tools/check.py
First From words to data's checks, unchanged: every moment draws, 30 a second, as the video does (check.py there), and no text is
drawn smaller than 28 px after the camera's zoom, the smallest that reads on a phone (legible.py there). Then one of the module's own:
each place the film paints (AG_PLACES), painted again from nothing (with the oak and the grain it shares), leaves the page drawing
again within LIMIT seconds. The site's player paints the places one by one while the film plays, so a place that keeps the browser
busy for seconds holds up the film, its soundtrack and the whole page. Paint what is soft anyway at a lower resolution and scale it up,
as room.js does with the marble. Last, the governance films' checks that nothing shows twice where the film changes shot or chapter
(films/data-governance/shared/tools/twice.py), that nobody's arm jumps in one frame (steady.py there) and that nothing jumps
where the film changes shot or chapter (jump.py there), and this module's own check that nothing painted for a person, such as a
hat, reaches past the edge of their picture, where it would be cut off in a straight line (edges.py, here)."""
