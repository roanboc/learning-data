// Context engineering, the opening film of Agents at work on data, the second series on AI agents in data work. One line per id; the film re-times itself to the voice.
// "gap": the beat after each line. "say": how the voice reads a line, when it differs from the caption (years in words). The few longer stops are in breath.js.
