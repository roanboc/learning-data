/* ===== In the weeds of data crafting: the video's finishing pass =====
   Loaded after the engine. Only the rendered video uses it (tools/render.py calls renderAt); the site's player draws live, as before.
   Motion blur: each video frame is the average of MB moments across a third of a frame (a 126-degree shutter), so movement reads as filmed; eight moments keep fast things smooth rather than doubled.
   Then a soft glow on the bright parts. Stills (tools/stills.py) don't show it.
   No film grain: noise doesn't compress, and a fine grain made the video more than twice as large (123 MB against 53 MB without it).
   The drift and the blur themselves double the size of a still-framed cut (53 MB against 27 MB): still small. */
