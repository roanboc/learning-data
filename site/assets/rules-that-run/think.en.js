/* Learning Data: "Pause and think" for Rules that run, in English. Keep the keys in step with think.es.js.
   The film stops at the end of three chapters (runs, level, list), with one question each. think.js shows them,
   and lists them again under "Think it through" (#think-list). The series' labs and scenarios are its own, for all its films
   (assets/data-governance/), so no question has a "stop"; the page's .player data-labs leads to them. */

    why:"A result said pass, warn or fail, and named only the check: not whose data it checked, or what kind of quality. That's how a warning ran every night for a year with nobody reading it. Once every check has an owner and a dimension in the rule register, the scorecard says whose it is, and a failure goes to its owner with a date. Which of your checks would reach a person tomorrow morning?"},

    why:"The level is the owner's, not governance's. The learning team knows one or two walk-ins a term are normal and follows them up, so any warns; more than five means something broke, so it stops. Planning chose the opposite for its census number, because it goes to the government. Each owner signs the level and its reason on a rule card, because a rule its owner doesn't understand gets ignored, then switched off. Who should set the level of your most important check?"},

    why:"Following up a walk-in is about what people do, not about the data, so it never stops the update: it's a list of cases the learning team works through. The check stays about the data only: an enrolment with no email. Which of your rules are really about what people do?"}
