# Why Unity Catalog and Unity Gateway govern them: the music and sounds, played by tools/audio.py with From words to data's
# instruments (shared/tools/music.py). A new palette, checked on 4 November 2026 against every score.py on main and against the series'
# other films (/mnt/project-files/agentic-data-engineering/series-2/palettes.md): an electric clavichord and a crumhorn, both made here
# (music.py has neither).
#  - The electric clavichord is the 1960s keyboard whose keys strike its strings with small rubber tips, the tone taken from the strings
#    by pickups. Here it is damped and soft: each key strikes its string exactly where it's set, and the note stops when the key is let
#    go (one set of rules, enforced where it lives). It plays the chords and the film's figure.
#  - The crumhorn is a Renaissance reed whose reed is shut inside a wind cap: the player's breath reaches the reed only through the cap,
#    and it can't overblow past its range. Played softly, low in its range, it is the agent's own voice, and it sounds where something
#    passes the gateway: every call goes through the cap, and no further than it's allowed.
#  - The mark: the same figure for a person and for an agent, B flat, E flat, D flat, G flat. Anil's key plays it on the clavichord alone,
#    when the agent takes it and signs in as him; given a name of its own, under the same rules as people, the agent plays it on the
#    crumhorn with the clavichord, together; the two play it again over the title card, then when Clara and the agent read the
#    staff table the same way, and on the film's last line.
#  - E flat minor for the nights and the trouble, G flat major (its relative major) for what the rules give; A flat minor, C flat
#    major and B flat minor at the turns. No D flat major chord: its fifth isn't pure in this tuning.
# The rules the series keeps (its briefs, 4 November 2026, as the module's other films do):
#  - Music only from time to time: under the opening story, and after it only at a chapter's turn, under a moment on screen or in a
#    pause without words; never a bed under the voice. tools/quiet.py checks how much, how often and how loud.
#  - Nothing trembles, pulses or beats: no vibrato, no tremolo, no ostinato; every chord is tuned pure (just intonation from E flat, see
#    hz()), so E flat minor, G flat major, A flat minor, C flat major and B flat minor are all pure. No urgent pulse: nothing in this
#    story is a rush.
#  - Every sound is an event on screen, at the moment it appears. Each one below uses the same timing as the picture in src/scenes.js
#    (the same word and offset), so sound and picture stay together when the voice is re-timed.
# And everything stays low and soft, below about 2.5 kHz.

# when a word of a line is spoken, as the film's own wAt() estimates it: along the line's voiced length, from the words the voice reads.
# wAt() falls back to the line's start when a word isn't in it; here a missing word stops the mix, so a typo can't move a sound
