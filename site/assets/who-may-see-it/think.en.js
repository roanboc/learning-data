/* Learning Data: "Pause and think" for Who may see it, in English. Keep the keys in step with think.es.js.
   The film stops at the end of three chapters (column, purpose, stars), with one question each. think.js shows them,
   and lists them again under "Think it through" (#think-list). The series' labs and scenarios are its own, for all its films
   (assets/data-governance/), so no question has a "stop"; the page's .player data-labs leads to them. */

    why:"A learner code names no one by itself, but the registrar's office keeps the list that links each code to a student, so the code is pseudonymous: still personal data. That's why even codes come with a purpose and an end date. What in your data looks anonymous but could lead back to a person?"},

    why:"Mei decides for her office: yes, for that purpose and until a date, or her office does the step that needs names. Yusuf told Clara why the stars are there and showed her the way to more, because a no without a way forward is how tables end up copied into spreadsheets. When someone asks you for more data, what way do you give them?"}
