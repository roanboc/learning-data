# Context engineering: the music and sounds, played by tools/audio.py with From words to data's instruments (shared/tools/music.py).
# The series' palette for this film (palettes.md, 4 November 2026: a lead no other film, on main or on a branch, has used): a monochord
# and a twelve-string guitar, both made here, as music.py has neither.
#  - The monochord, one gut string over a long box, its bridge moved to set each note, plucked with a quill: the instrument Guido
#    taught his singers with, each note named exactly. It names a note wherever a meaning is set down: the lines on the page, Mei's
#    answer, each of the four kinds of context. Its harmonic (the string touched at its middle as it's plucked: a pure, round note) is a
#    test that passes.
#  - The twelve-string guitar, fingerpicked softly: each note is a pair of strings tuned exactly together, the four low pairs an octave
#    apart, so one touch sounds two strings (written once, read by people and agents alike). It takes up what the monochord names, and
#    plays the chords of the story. A guess is one of its low notes, a wrong one, stopped short by the hand: in tune, never detuned, only
#    not the note on the page. A pair muted with the side of the hand is something not found, or out of reach.
# The mark: the monochord names one note, and the twelve strings take it up as a chord, each time in its own voicing: as the lines put
# the signs on the page, as the meaning goes onto the page, as Mei writes it in the glossary, as every agent and person reads the same
# page, as the agent cites her definition, and at the close.
# E Dorian for the opening (E minor, and A major for its sixth), E major once the page holds the lines. Every chord is tuned pure from
# E (just intonation, see hz()); F sharp minor and D with A, whose fifths aren't pure here, are never played, and a guess's wrong note is
# never held under a chord. The chant itself isn't scored: the boys and the masters sing in the picture, and the music leaves it to them.
# The rules the series keeps (its briefs, 4 November 2026; tools/quiet.py checks them):
#  - Music under the opening story, and after it only at a chapter's turn, under a moment on screen or in a pause without words; never a
#    bed under the voice; a figure never played again soon after itself; the music and the effects no louder than the governance films'.
#  - Nothing trembles or pulses: each note one string or one pair, steady, with no vibrato or bend, its partials harmonic, and the pairs
#    tuned exactly together (no shimmer, which would beat); the notes damped by the player before they'd ring into the next chapter. No
#    urgent pulse: nothing in the film is a rush.
#  - Every sound is an event on screen, at the moment it appears. Each one below uses the same word and offset as the picture in
#    src/scenes.js, so sound and picture stay together when the voice is re-timed.
# And everything stays low and soft, below about 2.4 kHz; the effects about 12 dB under the music.

# when a word of a line is spoken, as the film's own wAt() estimates it: along the line's voiced length, from the words the voice reads.
# wAt() takes a word's first appearance, even inside a longer word, and falls back to the line's start when it's missing; here either
# stops the mix, so a typo can't move a sound

# 1. The lines: the opening, the series' story from outside data. Arezzo, about 1025: the monochord names E, alone, and the twelve
#    strings come in on E minor with the place and year; Guido's name laid down; the church's chants, the Dorian's own colour, A major;
#    by ear, from a master, one low note. The page: a parchment leaf, and the card of the signs. A boy who has never heard the chant
#    guesses, twice, "a step?" and "a leap?": two wrong notes, short and low; the two masters each sing it their own way, two notes that
#    differ; the chant books set down, one for each master; ten years, a low chord that thins and is gone before "Something has to
#    change", which has nothing under it. Guido's answer: a quill draws each line, and the monochord names "one note"; the red line and
#    the yellow one, a fifth apart, as F and C are; the signs settle onto the lines, and the mark: E major arrives, held into the boys
#    singing a chant they have never heard. The ten years shrink; in Rome the pope turns two leaves, and the twelve strings take up the
#    verse he had never heard. One more line, today's staff. The agent reaches for the page, one note for what's on it; Mei's card and
#    the agent's guess, a wrong note; the meaning drawn onto the page, and the mark again in its own voicing; a low E under the title
