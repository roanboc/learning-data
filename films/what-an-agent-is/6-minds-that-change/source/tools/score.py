# Minds that change: the music and sounds, played by tools/audio.py with From words to data's instruments (shared/tools/music.py).
# A new palette, checked on 3 November 2026 against every score.py on main and on every branch, and against the series' other films:
# a piano played from inside, with no hammers, two ways. Its strings are bowed with rosined threads, one thread to a string, for the
# held notes and chords; the same strings are plucked by hand and damped with felt for the moments. Both are made here (music.py has
# neither). The same strings reached two ways is the film's idea in sound: two ways to one answer, which must agree. No instrument,
# scale or sound from Indian music, and no chant: the reciters' voices are not imitated.
#  - The marks mean the same all through. A verse's four words, a b c d, are four plucked notes rising, F A C D, and each pattern is
#    heard as it's drawn: joined, apart, in pairs, braided. A slip is the wrong note, G for C, plucked and damped short. When the
#    patterns agree, the bowed strings take up the notes the plucked ones played: the two ways agree (agree()). In Check the work, the
#    two routes are the two ways again: their counts end on different notes (134 on D, 131 on C), the slip's G sounds as the double
#    count is found, and, fixed, both end on C, and the bow takes it up.
#  - The three answers are three plucked endings, each different: home (F), a third above (A), the sixth (D); "are you sure?" leaves a G
#    hanging. Bartlett's retellings are a figure that grows shorter, and the two things the man added are two notes it never had.
#  - F major for the reciters, D minor for the problem; the university's chapters turn on D minor, A minor and B flat, and come home to
#    F as the advisers start.
# The rules the series keeps (its briefs, 3 November 2026, as the governance and master data films did):
#  - Music only from time to time: under the opening story, and after it only at a chapter's turn, under a moment on screen or in a
#    pause without words; never a bed under the voice. tools/quiet.py checks that after the opening no chapter has music for more than
#    half its length, or for 12 seconds without a break.
#  - Nothing trembles, pulses or beats: each bowed note is one string, held steady with no vibrato, its partials harmonic, as a bowed
#    string's are; every chord is tuned pure (just intonation, see hz()), and G is never held with D or B flat (their intervals aren't
#    pure here); the plucked notes are damped within about a second and a half, so none is held under another. No urgent pulse: the
#    film's turn is a slip found, not a rush.
#  - Every sound is an event on screen, at the moment it appears. Each one below uses the same timing as the picture in src/scenes.js
#    (the same word and offset), so sound and picture stay together when the voice is re-timed.
# And everything stays low and soft, below about 2.5 kHz.

# when a word of a line is spoken, as the film's own wAt() estimates it: along the line's voiced length, from the words the voice reads.
# wAt() falls back to the line's start when a word isn't in it; here a missing word stops the mix, so a typo can't move a sound

#    night: one soft F as the moon turns, twice. The team's record pinned; the next chat starts from it, a soft F as its thread reaches
#    the ring; Clara signs. The advisers start: F major, and it carries into the last chapter
