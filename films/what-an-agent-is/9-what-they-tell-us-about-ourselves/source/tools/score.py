# What they tell us about ourselves: the music and sounds, played by tools/audio.py with From words to data's instruments
# (shared/tools/music.py). A new palette, chosen on 3 November 2026 (the series' palettes.md) and checked against every score.py on
# main and on every branch: a Mellotron's flute tape, and tuning forks on wooden resonator boxes, struck with felt. Both are made here
# (music.py has neither). The film is about rough copies, and both instruments are copies of a kind: each Mellotron key plays about
# eight seconds of tape of a real flautist, and a fork gives the ear one pure note.
#  - The Mellotron plays the held notes and chords: a soft start as the tape meets the capstan, the flautist's breath, a faint hiss,
#    held steady (nothing trembles), and each note ends when its tape runs out, about eight seconds after the key goes down, so a chord
#    held longer is played again. Each key's tape is its own, a little louder or softer, a little more or less breathy.
#  - The forks are few and low, and sound only where hearing is on screen: a soft wooden knock, then a pure note that blooms as the box
#    takes it up. The film's mark is the C fork struck in the hand, set on its box, and answered by the Mellotron's chord: C major under
#    the title; at the end, left open, C and G with a D.
#  - Ten bands: when Rod's implant is switched on, the first chord is heard through ten bands, as the implant passes sound, and opens
#    into the full chord as he sings. The same ten bands come back wherever the film is about the copy's rough signal: "ten
#    electrodes", "ten rough signals", music through an implant, "the implant turned sound into pulses".
#  - Each of the five questions has its own note, rising, C D E G A, played as its card is pinned to the wall, and again when the card
#    goes back with its tag, over an open fifth: the questions stay open.
#  - C major, tuned pure over C = 256 Hz (scientific pitch, the forks' own); A minor for the opening's problem, whose chords fall A, G,
#    F to C as the problem turns to its solution. Silence while the implant goes in, and again at "It didn't hear anything".
# The rules the series keeps (its briefs, 3 November 2026):
#  - Music only from time to time: under the opening story, and after it only at a chapter's turn, under a moment on screen or in a
#    pause without words; never a bed under the voice. tools/quiet.py checks that after the opening no chapter has music for more than
#    half its length, or for 12 seconds without a break.
#  - Nothing trembles, pulses or beats: every chord is tuned pure (just intonation, see hz()), with no vibrato; D is never held with F
#    or A (their intervals aren't pure here). No urgent pulse: nothing in this film is an error or a rush.
#  - Every sound is an event on screen, at the moment it appears. Each one below uses the same timing as the picture in src/scenes.js
#    (the same word and offset), so sound and picture stay together when the voice is re-timed.
# And everything stays low and soft, below about 2.5 kHz.

# when a word of a line is spoken, as the film's own wAt() estimates it: along the line's voiced length, from the words the voice reads.
# wAt() falls back to the line's start when a word isn't in it; here a missing word stops the mix, so a typo can't move a sound
