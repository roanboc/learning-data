/* ===== Context and memory, governed: the scenes =====
   Six chapters, each timed to its narration: wAt(sc, "line", "word") is the moment a word is said. The places are painted once
   (world.js); what moves is drawn live in the shots of ag_shots. On one wall the camera glides on from shot to shot and only what
   changes fades; a new picture on the wall that names what the last one showed somewhere else is a later moment (later:true), so
   what was there leaves before it comes in, and a thing both show stays put, or slides. Between Lucía's corner and the quiet wall,
   shots that show the same people or words come in on a cut (cut:true), so nothing shows twice. The title card ends chapter 1, the
   end card chapter 6. */
