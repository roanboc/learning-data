# Fit for use

*The first series of the module Data quality.*

What "good" means for data, and how to measure it. The graduation list says who graduates, at which ceremony, with which award, and the name printed on each degree certificate; it passed all its checks, and still 41 certificates were printed again in December 2025. Four films: *Good enough for what?* (quality is fitness for a use: one list, four uses, a level for each); *A hundred records* (look at the data, and let the platform profile it, before writing a check); *Valid isn't true* (a check says a value is allowed; only a reference says it's true); and *Late is wrong too* (agree how fresh data must be, and always say how old it is). *Quality as a habit* follows. This folder also holds the plan for the whole module, in the [proposal](proposal.md), and the module's kit, in [`shared/`](shared/README.md).

**Status:** set up on 5 November 2026, on assumptions the author reviews later; the films are being made, one at a time, in order, each marked draft on the site, and appear in the table below as each one is out. On the site, the series sits under the topic *Data quality*, after *When things go wrong*, at `fit-for-use/`, once its opening film is out.

## The look and the sound

- **The quality bench**, assumed on 5 November 2026 for the author to review (the module's *Decided* table, in [proposal.md](proposal.md)): the data team's workroom, a wall of warm limestone and a long bench of dark speckled granite under a lamp in graphite enamel, with records as cream index cards, checks as gauges and tolerance bands, and results as tags in the verdict's colour, tied on with string (green passes, amber holds for a person, red stops, grey wasn't checked; brass is what good means for a use, steel blue a measure). The Great Hall is where the ceremonies happen. People, the camera and words are the agent films' kit, unchanged: every word at least 28 px in the 1920-pixel frame and none under the captions, people with an adult's proportions and one three-quarter head, arms down, and a camera that glides in one room and cuts only between rooms. The module's kit is in [`shared/`](shared/README.md), which says what each file holds; every film of both series bundles it as it is.
- **Its own sound in each film.** A lead instrument the site doesn't have, reserved for each film. Music under the opening story, then only now and then, at a chapter's turn or under a moment on screen; nothing loops, trembles or pulses, except an urgent pulse where a story turns to an error or a rush.

## How the films are made

Like the site's other series, each film is generated from code, with the engine, components, fonts and voice of *The Inner Life of Data*, *A Sharper Sketch*'s scenes, *From words to data*'s tools and the agent films' kit, and checked with the governance and agent films' checks (`twice.py`, `steady.py`, `jump.py`, `edges.py`, `legible.py`, `quiet.py` with `held.py`). A film keeps its own pictures and helpers in its own source. The example project, [`../analytics-engineering/project/`](../analytics-engineering/project/), is where the data story happens: what a film shows in dbt comes from it, and what a film needs that the project lacks is added to it in place. Each film's page links the official docs and standards it points to.
