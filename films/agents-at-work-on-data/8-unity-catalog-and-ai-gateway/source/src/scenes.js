/* ===== Why Unity Catalog and Unity Gateway govern them: the scenes, chapter by chapter =====
   Each chapter is a run of shots (ag_shots): a place painted once, a slow camera, and what's drawn live. Times come from the cues
   (c.<line>, when each line starts) and from the words of the lines (wAt), so the pictures stay with the voice. Every shot is in the
   lab, by day or by night, which is one room (AG_ROOMS): from shot to shot and chapter to chapter the camera glides on from where it
   is, what stays stays put, and only what changes fades. What both shots show is drawn the same; the agent that moves slides there
   once the dissolve is over (ug_slide); and a later moment, with other people or another page of cards, is marked later:true, so
   what was there leaves before what comes later comes in, through the bare room. */
