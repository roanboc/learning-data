"""Check the film before a long render: python tools/check.py
First From words to data's checks, unchanged: every moment draws, 30 a second, as the video does (check.py there), and no text is
drawn smaller than 28 px after the camera's zoom, the smallest that reads on a phone (legible.py there; a card that glided in from
far off once drew its words at 26 px for six seconds). Then one of this series' own:
each place the film paints, painted again from nothing, leaves the page drawing again within LIMIT seconds. The site's player
paints the places one by one while the film plays, so a place that keeps the browser busy for seconds holds up the film, its
soundtrack and the whole page. A blur set before many strokes of a full-size picture (the browser blurs every stroke) once held
the page for seven seconds; paint such a picture sharp on a layer and blur the layer once. Then nothing shows twice where the film
changes shot or chapter (twice.py), nobody's arm jumps in one frame (steady.py), nothing jumps where the film changes
shot or chapter (jump.py): in one room the camera glides, and what changes fades. And last, the site's player keeps up
(master data's smooth.py): drawn as the player draws it, with the places as pictures, no moment takes long, nothing big is painted
while the film plays, and what it keeps stays within its budget, also with the processor slowed four times, as on a phone."""
