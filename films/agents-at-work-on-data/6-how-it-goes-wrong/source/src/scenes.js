/* ===== How it goes wrong: the scenes, chapter by chapter =====
   Each chapter is a run of shots (ag_shots): a place painted once, a slow camera, and what's drawn live. Times come from the cues
   (c.<line>, when each line starts) and from the words of the lines (wAt), so the pictures stay with the voice.
   The room's shots keep a still camera: the tray's label stays above the captions, and each chapter ends on the plain room the next
   one opens on (its cards go 1.6 s before its end), so the crossfade between chapters shows nothing twice. Lisbon's pictures carry
   the corner tag, drawn over the shots (never in a dissolve), after each shot has come in and before the next. */
